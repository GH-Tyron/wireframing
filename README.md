# 🧩 Wireframing: From Concept to Prototype

## 📘 Introduction
**Wireframing** is a fundamental step in the **UI/UX design process** that involves creating a visual blueprint of a digital product’s layout and functionality.  
It serves as a guide for designers, developers, and stakeholders to understand the structure and flow of an application or website before moving into the full design and development phases.

Wireframes typically represent the **skeleton** of a digital interface — focusing on layout, navigation, and content placement rather than colors or detailed design elements.  

## 🎯 Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
Wireframing plays a crucial role in ensuring a smooth and efficient product design and development cycle. It helps to:

- **Visualize Structure Early:** Provides a clear view of how different components and features will be arranged.  
- **Enhance Collaboration:** Enables designers, developers, and stakeholders to align on design expectations before implementation.  
- **Save Time and Cost:** Detects usability issues and design flaws early, reducing the need for costly revisions later.  
- **Improve User Experience:** Focuses on content hierarchy, navigation flow, and functionality, ensuring user needs are prioritized.  
- **Support Prototyping and Testing:** Serves as the foundation for building high-fidelity prototypes and interactive designs.
